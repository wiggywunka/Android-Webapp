## FAQ ##

### Can I take the code and use it for my own app? ###
Sure, do go for it. I'm a random person on the Internet, why should I care?

### THIS CODE DOESN'T WORK? WTF? ###
Well...yeah. it's not gonna work right off the bat. You'd have to add a few files to get it up and running. If you need help with that, feel free to contact me! I'd be happy to help.

### Why should I use your code instead of writing my own? ###
That's a good question.
